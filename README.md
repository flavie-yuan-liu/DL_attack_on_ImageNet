# DL_attack_on_ImageNet

Implementation of attack learning algorithm based on dictionary leanring, specially for the Imagenet Dataset. 


> We have the trained model on 6 deep model, [download here]()
> To see a simple example of adversarial image generation with our model, just run
```
python main.py
```

> You can also train your own model. 
```
python demo_dL_attack.py --model densenet

```
There are some parameters to regulate in ADiL attack, make your settings to have the optimal ones.
